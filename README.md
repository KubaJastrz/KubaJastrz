### Hello 👋

🙇‍♂️ My name is Kuba and I create web applications for a living.

🧰 My current toolset includes:

- React and Tailwind for creating UIs
- Next.js, Remix and Astro as app frameworks
- NestJS, Prisma and PostgreSQL for backend stuff
- TypeScript, ESLint and Vitest for code quality
- Node and Bash scripts for automation

🔭 I'm also passionate about Developer Experience and have my eyes at the web ecosystem at all times.
